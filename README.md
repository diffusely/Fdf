# FDF - Wireframe 3D Renderer

## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

**FDF** is a simple 3D wireframe viewer written in C, built using the **MiniLibX** graphics library. It takes a file containing a 2D grid of height values and renders a 3D isometric projection of the terrain.

This project was developed as part of the 42 school curriculum.

## üì¶ Features

- 3D isometric projection of a heightmap
- Rotation on X, Y, and Z axes
- Zoom and movement controls
- Color gradients based on height
- Smooth line drawing (Bresenham‚Äôs algorithm)
- Custom projection matrix and transformations
- Lightweight, using only MiniLibX (no external engines)

## üß† Concepts

- Basic graphics programming with MiniLibX
- 3D to 2D projection
- Rotation matrices
- Line drawing algorithms
- File parsing and memory management

## üïπÔ∏è Controls

| Key           | Action                      |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| `W` / `S`     | Move map up / down          |
| `A` / `D`     | Move map left / right       |
| Arrow Keys    | Optional: fine movement     |
| `R`           | Rotate                      |
| `E`           | Change rotation mode (X/Y/Z)|
| `T`           | Switch to top-down view     |
| `+` / `-`     | Increase / Decrease Z-scale |
| `ESC`         | Exit program                |
